Notes:

This is my 2015 Summer Project that I made with Java. This is a 2D side-scrolling game made with most of the assets made by me
and the rest on the interweb. This is yet to be completely finished since I think there will be
potential to include alot more levels and features to this game. The code may be a mess since I'm 
not really done with everything yet, but I will try to improve on its readability. I used many tutorials and other people's
help to get to where I am in developing the game.

Controls:
Q: Sprint
W: Float
E: Fireball
R: Scratching
Space: Jumping (Press it again while in the air for a double jump!)
U: Upgrade Window
Y: Cancel Upgrade Window
ESC: Pause Menu
<-: Left
->: Right

Issues:
-I am missing a controls and a help page for the game at the moment
-So far My Pause Menu does not completely stop the game when the pause menu gamestate comes up.
-The audio portion of the game will only play on Windows when you are running it on Eclipse

Other assets:
-Main Menu Music and In Game Music from Adventure Time
-Boss music from youtube
-Victory Music from Final Fantasy
-Tiles from a Youtuber 
-BackGround Image from google image
